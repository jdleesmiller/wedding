        <h3>McKenzie Bridge, OR</h3>
        <p>Surrounded by miles of hiking and mountain biking trails, the wild waters of the McKenzie River and three
          massive waterfalls, McKenzie Bridge is one of Oregon's many gems.</p>
        <p>During your trip you may notice some burn areas. These are wild fire burns from recent years.</p>
        <p>In summer and early fall, a historic wagon route, now the McKenzie Passâ€“Santiam Pass Scenic Byway, winds
          through the lower and upper cascades. Between Mt. Washington and North Sister, it eventually leads to
          Dee Wright Observatory, a historic observatory built out of lava rock, surrounded by lava fields and
          old-growth forests</p>
