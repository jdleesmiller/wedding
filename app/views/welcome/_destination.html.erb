        <h3>McKenzie Bridge, OR</h3>
        <p>Surrounded by miles of hiking and mountain biking trails, the wild waters of the McKenzie River and three massive waterfalls, McKenzie Bridge is a favorite getaway for outdoor enthusiasts. Relax your weary muscles in the soothing, hot mineral water pools of Belknap Hot Springs.</p>
        <p>In summer and early fall, drive the McKenzie Passâ€“Santiam Pass Scenic Byway to Dee Wright Observatory, a historic observatory built out of lava rock, and hike through lava fields and old-growth forests to Proxy Falls.</p>
